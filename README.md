# Jira Helper
Helper tool to interact with Jira from CI/CD scripts. Its main purpose is to create and assign version
based on GitHub releases to Jira tickets.

You can provide comma separated issue numbers or a body of text which contains issue numbers and the jira-helper
will automatically assign the version to those issues in Jira.

## GitHub actions example
The following can be used to trigger a release (fixVersion) in Jira whenever a GitHub release is created. It will use the body of the
release and search for any issue numbers in it and automatically assign the newly created release to them.

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  release:
    types:
      - released

jobs:
  release-to-jira:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      IMAGE_NAME: ghcr.io/marcelblijleven/jira-helper:latest
    steps:
      - name: create release in Jira
        run: docker run -i --rm ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }} createRelease -u marcel@test.nu -s https://your-jira.address.nl -p MB -t=${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }} -v "${{ github.event.release.name }}"
      - name: assign release to Jira tickets
        run: docker run -i --rm ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }} assignVersion -u marcel@test.nu -s https://your-jira.address.nl -p MB -t=${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }} -v "${{ github.event.release.name }}" -b "${{ github.event.release.body }}" -r true

```
